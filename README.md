# ZigWFC

A library for using the WFC algorithm in Zig. Aims to provide simplicity, performance, and opt-in abstraction/features.

Written in Zig 0.12.0. Works in 0.11.0 if the instances of `std.posix` are renamed to `std.os`.

To get started with a quick demo executable, try:
```
zig build run -- -h
```
